My name is Edwin Benitez. IMG_0479 is a picture of my coworker's dog, Sally. She is a Corgi and very sweet. She can be easily startled by a slight noise. 
She loves bothering me when I cook food and enjoys being cuddled on her belly. 

A bit about of me, I am a computer science major focusing in CyberSecurity ,however, I will probably consider other branches of computer science depending on 
job-market factors.
